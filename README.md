project 0 for comp322 

takes the following arguments from the command line 

   a. .txt file with a series of 1s and 0s (eg. 01011101 101101..)
  
   b. a series of arguments on the command line(eg. 01011101 10110111 11101011 111101)
  
This program works as intended and by the criteria described by the lab writeup Making Sense of Ones and Zeros and later in class and on canvas.Â 

This program has gone through a series of changes to accomodate the dynamic criteria. As well as changes once i realized there was a far more efficient way to write this program.
