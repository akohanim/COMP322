Lab 1 for comp322

This program was developed by yours truely, in 2 main commits.
I completed the meat of this project in a 5 hour sitting from 8am - 1pm on saturday Feb 29th during lab. 
In the later updates I added comments cleaned up the code added makefile etc.  

This program works exactly as intended with no errors nor warnings.
