Lab 1 for comp322

This program was developed by yours truely, and uploaded in multiple commits. I completed the bulk of this project in a 5 hour sitting from 8am - 1pm on saturday Feb 29th during lab, hence the meat of this projecgt was uploaded in a single commit. In the later updates I added comments, cleaned up the code, added makefile, etc.


This program works exactly as intended with no errors nor warnings.
